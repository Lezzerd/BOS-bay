<p>Hestia’s Bastion - Basic Rules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: These rules, while enforced, may be subject to change at any time for any reason. Just because it’s not in the rules doesn’t mean you can’t get in trouble for it, use your brain and common sense to know what’s right and wrong or ask an admin for clarification!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rule #1: Role Playing</p>
<p>Participating in roleplay is encouraged, as we are a role playing server. The amount of RP may vary situation-to-situation, but should remain a constant element.</p>
<p>Disregarding RP entirely is generally unacceptable. Wordlessly and emotelessly getting into a fight is an example of disregarding RP. Antagonists, Command, and Security have stricter regulations on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not every fight is equal in stakes or circumstances. You don’t have to write a paragraph about how you slide across the cafeteria to start a fistfight. In an antag situation, a quick, short emote about pulling out your gun and firing works just fine, or you may instead elect to use the aim function without any triggers and yell to get down. These are just examples, and if you are uncertain, feel free to ahelp.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 1.5: The Chain That Binds</strong></p>
<p>On the fringes of civilization, the Captain's word is the supreme authority aboard his or hers vessel. While SOL-REG's are standard within Civilized-Space and generally are what Security are expected to uphold- Most threats to Frontier-Vessels are not easily put into such simple categorical charges. The Captain is expected to uphold both the trust and loyalty of their charges through any means necessary, and to bend the rules is not uncommon.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There are very, very few OOC rules on Bastion of Hestia. You may notice we do not even have a standard regulation pamphlet! Indeed, crimes are handled on a "Frontiersman" style. This is not a free-pass to execute everyone for everything imaginable, but this is certainly a pass for security and "civilian justice" to show off the absolute worsts of humanity. Antagonists may commit major atrocities, security may be little more than an authoritarian menace commanded by a tyrant Captain, the punishment for thievery could be as high as amputation of a hand: The Dagon is a sandbox, explore it at your hearts content!</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>We are not catering to the unrobust or those who wish to sip vodka-martini's by the bar. The vessel is expected to either thrive or fall into despair, action is expected: Players are free to make engaging storylines without the limitations of an OOC ruleset. Your actions are your roleplay. If you have two hands and a way? Then you're free to claim either victory or die trying.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Rule #2: Character Backstory / Naming / Records</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Character naming should always be taken seriously, as this is an RP server, and you should attempt to follow the below when it comes to naming.</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO: Naming a character based off something else (e.g. Peter Griffin, Michelle Obama, Gordon Freeman, ect.) * This rule doesn't apply if you're the creator of said character</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO: Naming a character that sounds vaguely similar or is in reference to another character (e.g. Tonald Drump, Griffin Peter, Freedon Gorman, ect.)</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO: Naming characters in a way that signifies a lack of RP. (e.g. Chad Thundercock, Orange Fluffytail, Killer Jack, ect.)</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO: Adding titles to your characters name, (e.g. Doctor / Dct., Mr./ Mrs., Jr./ Sr., ect.) *Using things like "Jack Moore IV" is acceptable as long as the number isn't absurdly high.</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO: Have a surname, regardless of species. The only exception to this is Genemodders/Custom Species, GAS, Robots and Vat Growns. - In the case of Vat Grown , if you lack a last name, you must substitute it with something such as digits, location name, etc .</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO: Attempt to follow naming schemes of your species, unless your characters backstory gives reason otherwise.</p>
<p>You have plenty of leeway for your characters creation-wise. Just use common sense.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Rule #3: Stay in Character</p>
<p>IC in IC. OOC in OOC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IC stands for “In Character”, while OOC stands for “Out of Character”.</p>
<p>Being in character is vital to roleplay and game experience. Do not use emoticons and text talk (e.g. “I c u”, “wtf man”, “how r u c:”).</p>
<p>Do not bring anything that is IC related into OOC chat, such as telling everyone in OOC that you are dead, if there is an issue always ahelp rather than immediately jumping to OOC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being out of character should only happen in the appropriate OOC channels on discord and when using LOOC / OOC in game, this also means that you should never bring anything OOC related into IC, such as your dislike of another player so you avoid healing them when they come through medical, or giving them a more harsh sentence &nbsp; in security. Conversely, bringing IC hate into OOC / LOOC rants is frowned upon and likely to have you muted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Rule #4: Metagaming</p>
<p>Communication taking place to share IC information regarding an ongoing round OOCly is a big no. This includes, but isn’t limited to :</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DMs / Voice Chat regarding ongoing in round happenings.</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Posting about the ongoing round OOCly.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Rule #5: Powergaming</p>
<p>Powergaming is doing more than your job entails, such as being a doctor that knows how to set up the engine, or being a cook that knows how to do surgery. Certain things can be made an exception to this rule, but generally you shouldn’t be MacGyver .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Powergaming also includes using game mechanics to your advantage in either combat, arrest, or roleplay when you shouldn’t be able to:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buckling yourself to a chair mid combat to cancel countdowns on certain abilities.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using instant grabs and pins on an applicable species to facilitate removing someone from the round permanently without reason, or to avoid RP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<p>-Using third party software to gain an advantage is strictly forbidden, and can lead to a permanent ban with no appeal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Anything that would be considered cheating, or rather, using exploits and bugs to your advantage is strictly forbidden, and will lead to a permanent ban with no appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Discord / Other :</strong></p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Material:</p>
<p>Don’t post content that could lead to Discord shutting down the Server. This is anything that may violate their terms of service, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Just use basic morals and you’ll be golden.</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brigading:</p>
<p>Participating in the harassment of other servers, or this server, will result in an immediate perma-ban.</p>
<p>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slurs:</p>
<p>Slurs that are derogatory and in reference to someone’s ethnicity / race are disallowed. This primarily applies to such things brought in from real life, into the context of SS13.</p>
<p>Slurs based off in game species, such as “Feather Face”, do not apply to this rule.</p>
<p>● &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Eighteen(18+)</strong>:</p>
<p>The server contains mature content. As such, players are required to be above the age of eighteen(18) at minimum. Anyone found below eighteen(18) will be immediately subject to a permanent ban without appeal.</p>
